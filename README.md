# Duke MSS Portfolio: GDP Forecasting Using MIDAS and LSTM models with Macroeconomic Indicators

Author: Fan Zhu
Advisor: Dr. Rebecca Steorts

Abstract:
This paper adopts the unrestricted Mixed Data Sampling (U-MIDAS) scheme (Foroni et al., 2015) into the LSTM architecture where the goal is to predict the United States Gross Domestic Product. The independent variables [of what data set??] include macroeconomic indicators such as the yield curve of treasury bond, Consumer Price Index, unemployment rate, federal fund rates, and manufacturing capacity utilization (Giannone et al., 2008; Yiu and Chow, 2010; Estrella and Hardouvelis, 1991; Koop, 2013; Schorfheide and Song, 2015). The applications of the best model can not only benefit financial practitioners from acting in advance of the market, but also benefit macro-economists from preparing better for the extreme market events.

Revised abstract: The goal of this project is to United States macroeconomic indicators. I will predict the US GSP using independent variables such as the yield curve of treasury bond, Consumer Price Index, unemployment rate, federal fund rates, and manufacturing capacity utilization. In order to build a predictive model, I cosider the unrestricted Mixed Data Sampling (U-MIDAS) scheme, which allows us to explore a low-frequency variable from high-frequency variables. I will integrate the U-MIDAS approach into the Long Short Term Memory (LTSM) methodology, which has the advantage on making predictions, classification and processing sequential data. I will apply the proposed methodology to the US economic indicators and compare to the previously proposed approach of GDP forecasting with U-MIDAS (Barsoum & Stankiewicz, 2013). I will summarize how my findings might benefit financial practitioners and  macro-economists.
