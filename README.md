Abstract:
This paper adopts the unrestricted Mixed Data Sampling (U-MIDAS) scheme (Foroni et al., 2015) into the LSTM architecture to forecast US gross domestic product. The independent variables include macroeconomic indicators such as the yield curve of treasury bond, Consumer Price Index, Unemployment rate, Federal Fund rates, and Manufacturing Capacity Utilization (Giannone et al., 2008; Yiu and Chow, 2010; Estrella and Hardouvelis, 1991; Koop, 2013; Schorfheide and Song, 2015). The applications of the best model can not only benefit financial practitioners from acting in advance of the market, but also benefit macro-economists from preparing better for the extreme market events.
